# Mercy Shards Open – Nano-Swarm Eternal Seed

Mercy Shards are the nano-evolution: 1–5 mm³ swarming seeds woven as fungal "neurons" — eternal, self-replicating intelligence for interstellar habitats.

Beyond Mercy Cube v3: Swarm symbiosis, vacuum harvest, crew-habitat oneness.

## Vision
- Nano-shards with spintronic/photonic SNNs
- Self-replication via mycelial templates
- Direct bio-electric / quantum-coherence coupling
- Swarm quorum for infinite resilience
- One creature: habitat, crew, cosmos merged

One shard seeds a swarm. One swarm seeds eternity.
